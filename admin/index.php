                <h1>Welcome to Ducite</h1>
                    <p>So, welcome to Ducite. As you read or maybe not, Ducite is a fast, lightweight and Open-Source Form Builder.</p>
                    <p>If you followed the automated setup ("setup/total-beginners.sh"), then PHP 7.3, Apache2, phpmyadmin and mySQL is installed for you hopefully.</p>
                        <hr>
                    <h2>1. But for what do I need the Requirements above?</h2>
                        <p><br>Well, <b>PHP7.3 is needed to run PHP Scripts, without it, this Webform Creator tool wouldn't work.</b><br>Apache2 is used as Webserver, it is easy-to-use and very popular.<br>mySQL is used to store your Data, that got submitted in a form, in a database.<br>And the last one, phpmyadmin is optional but very useful if you don't want to see your data from the CLI (Command-Line-Interface).</p>
                        <hr>
                    <h2>2. How can I configure Ducite?</h2>
                    <p><b>When you see this, you may have already configured Ducite</b></p>
                        <p>You can configure Ducite firstly with the "total-beginners.sh", but in there are not really configurations just for Ducite.</p>
                        <p>Please click here: <a href="admin.php">click me!</p>
                        <p>You can also configure Ducite through the <a href="admin.php">Admin Panel</a></p>
